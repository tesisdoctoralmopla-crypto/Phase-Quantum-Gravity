# Phase Quantum Gravity

A unified theoretical framework that resolves the cosmological constant problem, the dark matter puzzle, and the quantum measurement problem through the dynamics of a single complex scalar field—the Constitutive Field of Absolute Phase (CFCA).

## Overview

This work formalizes Constitutive Quantum Field Theory (CQFT), in which a Planck-scale complex scalar field Φ undergoes spontaneous U(1) symmetry breaking, yielding two physical modes:
- Phason (χ): the massless Goldstone boson (phase mode), identified as the mediator of gravity.
- Constituton (σ): the massive Higgs-like mode (amplitude mode), responsible for inertial rigidity and objective wavefunction collapse.

Key predictions:
1. Dynamical screening of vacuum energy: A non-minimal coupling ξRΦ†Φ + (β/2)(∂μχ)²R enables phase-dependent conformal suppression of Λ_bare, leaving a residual dark energy Λ_obs ∼ (H₀M_Pl)².
2. Apparent dark matter: Infrared self-interactions of χ generate a MOND-like 1/r force, explaining flat galactic rotation curves without particle dark matter.
3. Objective quantum collapse: Coupling matter to σ induces decoherence via a Lindblad master equation, with a critical mass M_cr ∼ 10⁹ amu—testable via nanoparticle interferometry (“Campaign G”).

## Experimental Test

The theory is falsifiable through nanoparticle interferometry. Detection of mass-dependent decoherence at M ≳ 10⁹ amu would provide direct evidence for the constitutive nature of the quantum vacuum.
